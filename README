MarkGone is a minimal markup language based on godoc.

MarkGone uses the minimal formatting syntax from godoc.
Unlike godoc, MarkGone processes plain text, not comments in go source code;

Philosophy

Markups are gone.
In other words, MarkGone text just looks like plain text.

Formatting Syntax

A heading is a single line
followed by another paragraph,
beginning with a capital letter,
and containing no punctuation.

Paragraphs are separated by one or more blank lines.

    To produce a pre-formatted blocks,
    simply indent every line of the block.
    Common indent prefix will be removed in output.

Source Code HighLight

MarkGone does not highlight pre-formatted blocks.
The highlighting can be done via JavaScript.
For example, with highlight.js:

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/styles/default.css">
	<script src="/path/to/highlight.pack.js"></script>
	<script>
	document.addEventListener('load', () => {
		hljs.configure({languages: ["go", "c", "scheme", "java", "js", "html", "css"]});
		const codes = document.querySelectorAll('pre');
		codes.forEach((code) => { hljs.highlightBlock(code); });
	});
	</script>

Extensions

If the first line is a single line, i.e. followed by a blank line,
then MarkGone uses it as the title.

Tags: space-separated tags on last line following at least one blank-line
